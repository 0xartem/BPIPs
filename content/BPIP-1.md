## Abstract
This specifies the process and provides guidelines for coordinating changes in Boson Protocol as an open source project. It follows heavily similar open source styles, such as PEP, BIP and EIP. 

Proposals may range from technical changes and new features in smart contracts, modifying the protocol parameters, as well as its surrounding SDK. Before implementation of the changes, polling the community via public voting is preferred.

## Motivation
Describing motivation behind a BPIP is crucial in order to understand why a proposal is needed and the project can't cover this need as-is. BPIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing, tracking and discussing changes to Boson Protocol.

## Specification (including type/scope)
Technical specification describes the proposed changed in a sufficient detailed that can be used as basis for in-depth discussion and later implementation.

This section must also include the type of the proposal as follows.

**Types of BPIPs**
* protocol - change of smart contracts layer
* core components - change of core components layer, SDK, 
* configuration - change of parametersâ€™ values of deployed protocol


## Rationale
Rationale explains the proposed specification, compares it to alternative designs and should include important objections or concerns.

## Backward compatibility (optional)
If a proposal introduces backward incompatibilities, they should be described here in detail. Else this section can be omitted.

## Implementation (optional)
An optional section that contains an example implementation that can be used to assist in understanding or implementing this proposal.
